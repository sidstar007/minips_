Minips is a budgeting and finance management android application that lets users track their income and expenses.
Users can create multiple custom budget categories and allot a certain amount to them, the amount alloted to each
category gets updated based on the transaction performed within them (credit or debit). The main page contains an user
dashboard that displays information regarding total savings, expenses and balance. Apart from these there are also 
searching and filtering features for transactions and budgets making it easier for the user to revisit a previous 
transaction faster. Some other features include future payments reminder, AI analysis and personalised feedback
powered by Open AI API for helping users make better financial decisions.

The app is based on Kotlin and uses SQLite for storing and retrieving user data.
